### OrderDeliverySystem

#### The main objective of the project :
programming a delivery system that serves the user and provides him with many good drivers to deliver their orders, with the addition of many special delivery offers
#### A simplified idea of our delivery system:
a system that allows the user to enter his personal Information and his location data , then displays many stores for him to choose from, then he chooses what he wants from the orders and they are saved for him in the cart, he will be shown many drivers present in his area to deliver his order and submit offers especially for him


#### more details:
First, the user will be asked to enter his personal information like first name, last name, phone number,
and he must enter valid values, otherwise he will be asked to re-enter them.
Next, a list of available payment methods will be displayed to the user to choose from,
credit card, app wallet, cash on delivery. If he choose credit card, he will be asked to 
enter a credit card number consisting of 16 digits, if he entered more or less
he will be asked to enter a valid 16 digits number. If he choose to pay from app wallet, 
he will be asked to specify the amount he wants to add to the app wallet. Or he can choose 
to pay cash on delivery. Then, he will be asked to choose his delivery area from the displayed addresses,
and then based on the area he choose, a number of neighborhoods will be displayed to choose his exact location.
Based on the address, all stores will be displayed from the closest to the user address to the farthest,
and the user will be prompt to choose a store. If he choose a store that's not in the shown list,
he will be asked to choose from the list only. Then, the system will check if the store is open at that time, 
if not, "The store is closed" message will appear. 
If the store is open, all the products provided by the store will appear on the screen.
After that, the user will be asked to choose the products he wants, and the quantity. He will be able to view his cart and modify it,
adding more items or removing items. Then he can print the invoice of his order.
Then, available drivers will show up to the user, if all drivers are busy with other orders, the user will be asked to try again later, 
otherwise, he will be asked to choose a driver from the list. The program will let the user know that his order has been approved,
and is out for delivery.
Finally, the program will ask the user to rate the driver service out of 5, and the service quality of the store, and to 
type in the reason fot his rating.
